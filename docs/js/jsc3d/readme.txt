JSC3D is a lightweight 3D model viewer and toolkit based on HTML5 and JavaScript. It provides a handy tool for online design sharing and product exhibition. Both WebGL and Canvas based Software rendering are supported to be compatible with most browsers. A modified edition for InternetExplorers(version<9) which do not fully support HTML5 is also available.

JSC3D is freely distributable under the terms of the MIT license. The project's official website is hosted on http://code.google.com/p/jsc3d/.


Supported File Formats:

 - Wavefront obj
 - STL (both binary and ascii)
 - Autodesk 3DS


Updates since 1.4.2

 - Added support for WebGL rendering.
 - Added support for loading Autodesk 3DS files.
 - Made the default progress bar hideable so that a user-defined progress indicator can be used instead.
 - The default progress bar and the error message bar were re-implemented using CSS. This fixed occasional flickers when loading.
 - Added support for panning control.
 - Improved the touch based navigation mechanism and added support for pinch zooming.
 - Fixed a bug that when a new request is started and the previous request is not completed, the previous one cannot be cancelled correctly.
 - Each JSC3D.Mesh instance now can be set a seperate render mode which overrides the viewer's render mode setting in rendering.
 - Enabled larger texture dimensions up to 1024x1024.
 - The platform info collector is now able to recognize IE11 and above.
 - Added patch to deal with non-standard face statements in obj files generated by LightWave3D.
